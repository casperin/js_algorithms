# [Singly-Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

Their primary usecase is in low level languages where you have to specifically allocate memory, since the linked list can be arbitarily big without any single unit taking up a lot of memory.

In JavaScript the only use I see for them is for a stepper of sorts that only can go forwards.
