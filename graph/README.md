# Graph

In these algorithms graphs nodes are represented as numbered from `0` to `n`, connect to any number of other nodes.

A graph may be represented as an array of connections. Each connection being a tupple consisting of the two connected nodes.

```js
// A graph of the numbers 0-2, each connected to each other.
const graph = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]];
```
