# [Bucket sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort)

Bucket makes most sense when you know which range of numbers you're dealing with, and whether you're only working with integers.

I chose for this to deal with numbers between 0 (including) and 1 (excluding). It also makes use of insertion-sort to sort individual buckets.
