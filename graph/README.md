# Graph

In these algorithms graphs node with some data, connect to any number of other nodes.

A graph may be represented as an array of connections. Each connection being a tupple consisting of the two connected nodes.

```js
// A graph of the numbers 1-3, each connected to each other.
const graph = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]];
```
